# wifi-wand Release Credentials Configuration
#
# This file contains 1Password CLI references for signing and notarizing
# the macOS helper application before gem releases.
#
# ## Setup Instructions
#
# 1. Create (or rename) a 1Password Secure Note called "wifiwand-release"
#    and add structured fields (private credentials only):
#      - APPLE_DEV_ID (type: Text)       → Your Apple Developer account email
#      - APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD (type: Password) → App-specific password from appleid.apple.com
#
#    Note: Team ID and codesign identity are now hardcoded in lib/wifi-wand/mac_helper_release.rb
#    (they're public values visible in signed binaries anyway - no need to hide them)
#
# 2. Update the vault name below if using a different vault (consumer accounts
#    typically use "Personal"; team accounts often use "Private")
#
# 3. Use with 1Password CLI:
#      op run --env-file=.env.release -- bundle exec rake dev:release_helper
#
# ## Alternative: Direct Environment Variables
#
# If not using 1Password, set these directly (private credentials only):
#   export WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_ID="you@example.com"
#   export WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
#
# ## 1Password References (edit vault name if needed)
#
# Format: VARIABLE_NAME=op://VAULT_NAME/ITEM_NAME/FIELD_NAME
#
# Only private credentials are stored in 1Password.
# Public values (team ID and codesign identity) are hardcoded in lib/wifi-wand/mac_helper_release.rb

WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_ID=op://Personal/wifiwand-release/APPLE_DEV_ID
