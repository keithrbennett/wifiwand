# wifi-wand Release Credentials Configuration
#
# This file contains 1Password CLI references for signing and notarizing
# the macOS helper application before gem releases.
#
# ## Setup Instructions
#
# 1. Copy this file to .env.release:
#      cp .env.release.example .env.release
#
# 2. Create a 1Password item called "WiFi-Wand Release" with these fields (private credentials only):
#      - APPLE_DEV_ID: Your Apple Developer account email
#      - APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD: App-specific password from appleid.apple.com
#
#    Note: Team ID and codesign identity are now hardcoded in lib/wifi-wand/mac_helper_release.rb
#    (they're public values visible in signed binaries anyway - no need to hide them)
#
# 3. Update the vault name below if using a different vault (default: "Private")
#
# 4. Use with 1Password CLI:
#      op run --env-file=.env.release -- bundle exec rake dev:release_helper
#
# ## Alternative: Direct Environment Variables
#
# If not using 1Password, set these directly (private credentials only):
#   export WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_ID="you@example.com"
#   export WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
#
# ## 1Password References (edit vault name if needed)
#
# Format: VARIABLE_NAME=op://VAULT_NAME/ITEM_NAME/FIELD_NAME
#
# Only private credentials are stored in 1Password.
# Public values (team ID and codesign identity) are hardcoded in lib/wifi-wand/mac_helper_release.rb

WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_ID=op://Private/WiFi-Wand Release/APPLE_DEV_ID
WIFIWAND_APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD=op://Private/WiFi-Wand Release/APPLE_DEV_PASSWORD
