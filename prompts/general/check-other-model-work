Ask me for a target for `git diff [target]` (with a default target of the `add-ubuntu` branch) and what was the intent of the code changes.

Do the `git diff` to see the code changes implmented to accomplish the specified intent.

Review these changes carefully and thoroughly and tell me:

* will the changes achieve the desired goal?
* are they following best practices?
* DRY is very important -- can the code be implemented more concisely?
* what are the strengths and weaknesses of the approach used?
* risks of security, obsolescence, etc.?
* is there an alternate approach that would be better?
