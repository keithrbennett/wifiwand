    # Fast connectivity check optimized for continuous monitoring (e.g., log command).
    #
    # This method provides a quick internet connectivity test that:
    # - Uses only 3 geographically diverse TCP endpoints
    # - Has a short 1-second timeout per endpoint
    # - Returns immediately when first endpoint responds (~50-200ms typically)
    # - Works globally including China (uses Baidu endpoint)
    # - Skips DNS testing (often cached, less useful for real-time monitoring)
    #
    # Endpoints tested:
    # - 1.1.1.1:443 (Cloudflare) - Fast globally except China
    # - 8.8.8.8:443 (Google) - Fast globally except China
    # - 180.76.76.76:443 (Baidu) - Fast in China, accessible globally
    #
    # @return [Boolean] true if any endpoint is reachable, false otherwise
    #
    # Performance:
    # - Best case: ~50-200ms (when any endpoint responds quickly)
    # - Worst case: ~1 second (when all endpoints timeout)
    #
    # This is ideal for the log command where speed matters more than thoroughness.

    # Runs connectivity checks in parallel using fiber-based concurrency.
    #
    # This method uses the `async` gem to run multiple checks concurrently with the following behavior:
    # - Returns `true` as soon as ANY check succeeds (early exit optimization)
    # - Returns `false` if ALL checks fail OR the overall timeout is reached
    # - Each individual check runs with its own timeout (defined in the yielded block)
    # - All checks run concurrently within the overall timeout window
    # - Tasks are cancelled as soon as first success is detected (true early exit)
    #
    # Implementation Details:
    # The async gem uses fibers (not threads) for lightweight concurrency. Fibers are:
    # - More memory-efficient than threads (uses cooperative multitasking)
    # - Better for I/O-bound operations like network checks
    # - Scheduled by the Ruby VM rather than the OS
    #
    # Why Async::Barrier?
    # Barrier collects results from all concurrent tasks and provides:
    # - Automatic task lifecycle management (no manual fiber cleanup needed)
    # - Clean cancellation when first success occurs
    # - Exception isolation per task (one failure doesn't crash others)
    #
    # @param items [Array] Collection of items to check (endpoints, domains, etc.)
    # @param overall_timeout [Float] Maximum seconds to wait for any check to succeed
    # @yield [item] Block that performs the actual connectivity test
    # @yieldparam item The current item being tested
    # @yieldreturn [Boolean] true if check succeeded, false otherwise
    # @return [Boolean] true if any check succeeded within timeout, false otherwise
    #
    # @example Testing TCP connectivity to multiple endpoints
    #   endpoints = [
    #     { host: '1.1.1.1', port: 443 },
    #     { host: '8.8.8.8', port: 443 }
    #   ]
    #
    #   success = run_parallel_checks(endpoints, 5.0) do |endpoint|
    #     attempt_tcp_connection(endpoint)
    #   end
    #
    # Performance Characteristics:
    # - Best case: Returns immediately when first check succeeds (~50-200ms)
    # - Worst case: Waits `overall_timeout` seconds when all checks fail
    # - Memory: O(n) where n is number of items (one fiber per item)
    # - CPU: Minimal, as checks are I/O-bound
    #

        # If this expires, Async::TimeoutError is raised and caught below.

          success_found = false

          # Shared flag to track success status.
          #
          # Thread-safety note: This boolean flag is safe without mutex protection because:
          # 1. Async uses cooperative (not preemptive) multitasking with fibers
          # 2. Fibers only yield at explicit I/O operations, not during regular Ruby code
          # 3. Boolean assignment is atomic at the Ruby level
          # 4. We only ever set it to true (never back to false), avoiding race conditions
          # 5. The check-and-stop operation completes before another fiber can execute
          #
          # Execution flow:
          #   Fiber A: I/O (yields) → I/O completes → success_found = true (atomic) → barrier.stop
          #   Fiber B: I/O (yields) → still running... → gets cancelled by barrier.stop
          # The assignment and barrier.stop never interleave because they don't contain yield points.
