# Apply All Automatable Rubocop Changes to the Code Base

### Ensure Rubocop is in the Bundle

If Rubocop is not already configured as a dev dependency, fix that, and run bundle to install it.

### Fix the Rubocop Violations

- Given the repo's .rubocop.yml file, branch from main and implement all the automatable Rubocop fixes that can be done.
- Apply a separate commit for each Rubocop rule.
- You can get help from rubocop by calling `rubocop -a`.
- If you have any questions, try to ask them as early as possible in the process.
