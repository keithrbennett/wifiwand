# Development Prompts

This directory contains prompts used for AI-assisted development and documentation generation. These are internal tools for maintainers, not user documentation.

## Directory Structure

- `doc-gen/` - Prompts for generating documentation
- `feature_specs/` - Prompts for implementing new features
- `general/` - General-purpose development prompts

## Usage

These prompts are designed to be used with AI coding assistants (like Claude Code) to help with repetitive development tasks such as:

- Generating OS command documentation
- Implementing new features consistently
- Applying code style fixes across the codebase

## Note

These files are for internal development use only and are not part of the user-facing documentation.
